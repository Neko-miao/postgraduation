# Skinned Instancing  

## Instancing
- Render a mesh multiple times with dirfferent
    - location
    - color  
    - etc.
- Usually static meshes
    - e.g. grass, leaves, other things that one needs a lot of
    - can't be in different animations  

- Uses constant memory to store data  
- Used to transfer workload from CPU to GPU  

## Skinned Instancing  
- Same as Instancinng bug uses texture memory to store data.

- How to work?
    - SV_InstanceID (generated by GPU)
    - Texture stores all anniamtions  
        - instead of constannt memory because of the amount of data
        - offset used to access the right annimation  
        - texture fetches are fast  
        - texture animation is a multiple of 4
